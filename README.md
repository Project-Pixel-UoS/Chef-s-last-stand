# Chef-s-last-stand
The food at the cafe is so good that no matter what the chefs do, the mice keep on sneaking into the kitchen and stealing their food! The chefs are at their witâ€™s end, and have decided to take matters into their own hands. The chefs picked up their cooking utensils and are now waiting for the mice to attack, and finish them once and for all.
